Teacher-friendly Classroom Seating Chart Wizard

## Overview

### What is it?
A visual tool to help teachers arrange desks and assign seats in their classroom

### Why?
Creating seating charts is often time consuming for a number of reasons:
- Some students need to be near the front
- Some students need to be near the door
- Some students need to be away from other students
- Some configurations such as groups require several criteria to be met for each group
- Desks need to be arranged in a way that allows all students to be able to see teacher/resources
- Many more including disciplinary reasons, medical situations, disabilities, and so on

Manually creating these seating charts, given all these different criteria, is a time-consuming task often involving a lot of sticky notes, erasing, glasses of wine, etc. This app aims to ease this burden by automating many of the most annoying aspects.

### How?
At the beginning of the year, teachers will enter all the baseline seating criteria for each student, i.e. must sit by door for restroom access, must be near front for vision, and so on. This information can be edited and expanded upon throughout the year when more criteria become apparent or new students join the class.

Teachers will also create their desk layout. They can choose from several options such as standard desks, rectangular tables, or round tables. They will be able to make a rough visual representaion of their classroom and put the desks into the arrangement they want, such as rows, pods, evenly spaced, etc.

Once this information is entered, the app will distribute students randomly into the desk layout, avoiding conflicts and adhering to the previously entered criteria. Teachers will be able to regenerate random arrangements as many times as they like until they are satisfied. They will also be able to manually control specific students' placements if they desire, and 'lock' them into place. Locked students will remain in their assigned desk even if the randomizer is run again.

### Technology
This app will be built first using standard HTML, CSS, and Javascript. However, I believe this app has a strong use case to be built in React, so I may move it in that direction once the concept is proved and basic functionality is achieved.
