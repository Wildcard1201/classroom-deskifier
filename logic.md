## Student Criteria
Student-specific criteria that affect seating placement
- Eyesight - Students with poor eyesight may need to sit near the front of the room to see the board
- Illness - Students with long-term illness may need to sit near the door for reastroom access or medical care
- Injury - Students with an injury may need to be accomodated; leg injury may need a desk with easy access, arm in a cast may require no other student on a particular side, etc
- Behavior - Students with disciplinary issues may need to be away from other students, or specific students may need to be separated

## Classroom Layouts
### Desk Arrangments
- Spaced columns - desks are spaced evenly apart from one another in neat columns facing the front. The traditional layout most people picture.
- Staggered columns - similar to spaced columns but each row is staggered horizontally to create a diamond pattern. Increased spacing between students for privacy or pandemic requirements. Takes up more space.
- Pods/Groups - groups of desks, usually 4 to 6, arranged in a group and facing each other, i.e. two deks on one side facing an opposite set of desks. Similar to sitting at a table facing one another.
- Tables - similar to pods but actually using tables instead of desks. Options for table shape and number of students.
- U-shaped - Desks are arranged in a large 'U' shape, allowing the teacher to teach in the center and be seen by everyone up-close.
- Custom - make your own custom layout.

### Sorting Methods
All methods use entered data to avoid conflicts and place students with needs where they need to be
- Random - completely random placement. Can be repeated until desired layout is produced.
- Class number - students arranged by their assigned class number
- Alphabetical - students arranged by last name
- Student-chosen - allow students to pick their own seats and enter info manually. Good luck.
